1.What is programming
programming is a process of writing a instruction which computer can understand. Instruction means code which we write to perform some tasks.

2.Compiler
It is a software which converts human readable codes into machine readable code at once, ex : c, c++, java.

3. Interpreter
It is a software which converts human readable codes into machine readable code at a line by line code. ex : python, JavaScript.

##Programming languages are classified into two types: 
low level languages and high level languages

** Low Level Language : It directly interact with hardware, It is fast and difficult. ex: Assembly language and machine code.

** High level language : It is easy to read and write, It needs a translator to translate a human readable codes into machine codes, To translate we use either compiler or interpreter, It is Slower as compare to level language. ex: c++, java.

## What is Python?
: Python is high level interpreter programming language, it was developed by Guido van Rossum in 1991, It is used to web development , data science , data analytic, AIML, automation etc.
It is known for its easy syntax which is easy to learn.

## What is Syntax?
: In programming syntax means set of rules that define the structure and format of a programming language and features of python(easy to learn, interpretred language, cross platform, use library support, open source , object oriented programming, functional programming, scalable and fast)
Note: To create a python file the extension should be .py. ex: demo.py.
Note : Print() = It is a inbuilt function which is used to display some output in our terminal .

## Comments:
Comments are notes written in code that aree ignored by compiler or interpreter when the program runs, Comments are for human to explain the code or to temporarily disable a part of code , To create comments in python there are two ways :
1.	Single line comments : use # symbol at the starting of the line to create a single line comments.

2. Multi line comments : Technically python does not have a built in multi line comments syntax but we can create by using triple quote (''') ("""). 

##Variables:
Variables are the containers which are used to store some value or data in a programming language , Rules to create variables : 

1. Name should not have any space 
2. Name should not start a number 
3.No special characters are allow except underscore(_) 
4. Keywords can not be used to create a variable 

Data Types are the category which specify which type of value a variable can store.
##Number Types :
There are three types of number types 
a. Int: It stores whole positive or negative number. ex= a =10, b=-20
b. float type : it stores floating point or decimal positive or negative numbers. ex: 1..23
c. Complex Types : It is the combination of real number and imaginary part.
-This is used for scientific calculations.
eg: a+xj, 5+aj

##Boolean Type:-
It represents only two value that is True and False
It is used for logical operations.

##Sequence Types:-
It stores ordered collection of items in a single variable.
There are three types of sequence variables :

a. String : Sequence of characters which is written inside single or doble quotes.
eg: str = "Hello", 'Hi'

b. Lists: It is a collection of multiple values in a single variable.
It is mmutable in nature
It is denoted by square Bracket [].
eg: name = ['sumit', 'Golu']

c. Touple: It is a collection of multiple values in a single variable.
It is immutable in nature. It can't be changed once created.
It is denoted by curly braces {}
eg: marks = {10,20,30}


##Set Types:-
It is a collection of unordered unique value.
It is denoted by curly braces
eg: item = {1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6}
output will be unique 

## Mapping Types
It has one data type:

a. Dictionary (dict) :- It is a collection of unordered mutable key value pairs

We can store any type of value in a single dictionary.
eg:- object = {
name : 'ABAC',
marks : 60,
age : 20
}
It is denoted by curly braces and each key value pair is separated by comma(,).

##None Types:-
None means Nothing 
It represents the absence of a value.
eg: a = None

Note:- type() function is used to check the data type of a variable or object.


##Operators 
Operators are the symbols or keywords used to perform 
Operations on variables and value or operands.
eg : a+b
a-b
a/b
a*b

here a and b are operands and '+,-,/,*' are the operators

1. Arithmetic Operators:- used for mathematical operations with numeric values.
+:Addition
-:Subtraction
/:Division
*:Multiplication
%:Modulus(Remainder)
**:Power or exponent
//:Floor division(Round Value)

2. Assignment Operators:- Used to assign value to variables.
=  : Assigns value to variable
+= : Adds and Assigns value to the left operand
-= : Subtract and assign value to the left operand
*= : Multiply and assign value to the left operand
/= : Divide and assign value to the left operand
//=: Flloor divide and assign value to the left operand
%= : Modulus and assign value to the left operand
**=: Powers and assign value to the left operand
